# Test coverage

Run all groups with `sbcl --noinform --script scripts/test.lisp`.
The suite is connected to `asdf:test-system "mognitio"`.

| Acceptance IDs | Coverage |
|---|---|
| V01–V02 | Both literals, eight conditional combinations, nested conditions and branches |
| V03–V04 | Whitespace, EOF, allowed BOM and invalid BOM placement |
| V05–V08 | Strict UTF-8 byte boundaries, invalid words/characters, source locations |
| V09–V12 | Empty input/blocks, missing delimiters/else, extra input, excluded grammar |
| V13–V14 | Full semantic traversal, malformed ASTs, checked boundary, generated form structure |
| V15–V16 | Compile flags/errors, canonical results, branch evaluation, host output isolation |
| V17–V19 | Arguments, literal paths, permissions, phase stopping, real process failure statuses |
| V20 | Other working directories, Unicode/spaced names, cold/warm compiler caches |
| V21 | Repeated executions, generated programs, grammar mutations, clean full-suite run |

The generated tests use independent test trees, a renderer, and a boolean
evaluator. They exhaust depth 0 and depth 1, then take 128 reproducible
samples with seed 9622 and maximum depth 5. Depth and sample index are
reported on a generated-case failure. This bound applies only to the tests.

Subprocesses use argument lists and separate stdout/stderr files, with a
20-second harness timeout and forced cleanup on timeout. Each suite run
owns a fresh temporary directory. Fault injection is confined to the test
system and test entry; there are no public CLI fault flags.

Valid v0.1 source cannot produce a non-boolean type. Semantic-failure
classification is therefore tested through injected compiler conditions;
malformed internal ASTs must produce internal failures instead.

The host result alone cannot show that an unselected pure branch was not
evaluated. Tests check generated CL:IF forms and observe evaluation with
test-only host effects. Production execution always calls the host compiler.
